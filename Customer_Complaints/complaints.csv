"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Hello This complaint is against the three credit reporting companies. XXXX, Trans Union and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The response from XXXX and XXXX  was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XX/XX/XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. 
I wrote XXXX and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only XXXX wrote back a letter dated XX/XX/2019 stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. 

Trans Union never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019 to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with TransUnion, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. 

Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because XXXX, XXXX and Trans union all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I. I demand that these items on my account that was not verified be removed from my account because they are in violation of my rights and not to mention, Trans union did not even respond to my investigation request.","TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,109XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Old information reappears or never goes away,"Experian, XXXX and XXXX are reporting inaccurate and false information on my credit report. 

Experian is reporting XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MD XXXX that address would removed and put back on. I have also never lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MD XXXX. 

XXXX has reported that an account for XXXX XXXX with last date reported XX/XX/XXXX, Experian and XXXX doesnt show enough information for the XXXX XXXX account. Theres no balance, no high credit limit, the date of last activity for experian is XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX is showing the dates of last active as XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX, how can that be if I filed bankruptcy years ago with this account?? Experian and XXXX doesnt have enough information about the count. Hey he dates of last activity are all mixed up, theres no information about the credit limit or anything. 

XXXX XXXX is showing that the account with XXXX was last active on XX/XX/XXXX. This is incorrect. XXXX is showing last active of XX/XX/XXXX and doesnt show balance for XXXX XXXX doesnt show any information on payment status or credit limit. There nothing showing what type of account it is. All this information doesnt seem like it has been verified because theres so much missing information. Experian. Shows that the account wasnt opened on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX and XXXX show Date opened on XX/XX/XXXX. What information is accurate?? 

XXXX is postponing XXXX as open account type but the account status says closed. The accounts also show that theres no high credit limit but theres a balance due of {$84.00}! How can that be. Date last active is incorrect as well. 

XXXX XXXX is showing for XXXX incorrect and missing information. Theres no balance for no high credit limit, no credit limit. XXXX shows account status as other but Experian shows as closed. Experian also has the account as last reported on XX/XX/XXXX and a XXXX shows XX/XX/XXXX. What is correct? Why is all the information reporting differently? 

XXXX XXXX is showing for XXXX that the account is indeterminate? Who is verifying this information? The account type is left blank, high credit limit is left blank. There is too much information left blank. 

XXXX is posting that I have 2 dismissed chapter XXXX and one dismissed Chapter XXXX. They are all missing information Reference numbers are wrong for The chapter XXXX. They also are saying I filed at US DISTRICT COURT that is incorrect. The status is missing, the date settled is missing, the liability amounts are missing. 

For XXXX its showing that I filed a chapter XXXX at BK ... who is Bk? This information is inaccurate. The date settled for the Bks are incorrect. 

Experian shows all inaccurate account reference numbers. Dates settles are incorrect. 

All these accounts are in violation of the FCRA. They have you provide me with how they verified any of this information which leaves me to believe that they are not conduction reasonable investigations or following then procedures or obeying laws.

At the time i was uninsured but was told i could be retroactively covered via colorados healthcare/XXXX. 

I applied and was accepted to the program within the time frame. It later went to collections and i was served with a summons to XXXX County Court in XXXX, Colorado by the collectors in XX/XX/XXXX.

During that period i provided the plaintiff ( the collection agency and their representatives ) with a load letter officially stating i was covered for the costs incurred in XX/XX/XXXX. 

A motion for continuance was requested as they billed medicaid. On XX/XX/XXXX the case was dropped as the situation was resolved. 

In XX/XX/XXXX i checked my credit report via XXXX and noticed i had a collections appearing. This was part of the collection that was solved and should not have appeared. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX MST i submitted a dispute with the credit agency XXXX  including the letter saying my medicaid covered it, the official case dismissed paper signed by a judge, and the original summons complaint. 

On XX/XX/XXXX i was told the dispute was unsuccesful. 

"" The company that reported the information has certified to XXXX that the information is accurate. This item was not changed as a result of our processing of your dispute. Please review your report for the details. '' Because the collection agency still said i owed. I did not.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"This complaint dates back to last XX/XX/XXXX during a loan modification which was done with XXXX ( Account # XXXX ) my previous loan servicer this was after a 2 month forbearance after Hurricane Irma. They had indicated a shortage to my escrow account in the loan modification documents. I was provided different information every time I spoke on the phone with a XXXX   representative. One would say I had an overage, others would say I had a shortage. The modification documents indicated at {$1900.00} shortage. I called, I emailed and wrote letters, I requested a Escrow review of my account in XXXX and XXXX and was told one would be done. They kept delaying and I finally had to sign the Modification documents on XX/XX/XXXX under duress otherwise the Modification would be withdrawn. No review of my escrow was ever done by XXXX, I discovered what appears to be an error when I reviewed the two Escrow Disclosure statements from XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. The Escrow balance for XX/XX/XXXX shows an actual escrow balance of {$2200.00}, the next statement shows a XXXX actual balance for XXXX, a difference of XXXX when only XXXX should have been withdrawn from this account to pay for the monthly mortgage insurance. I have recently contacted by phone and email to XXXX and they have not responded. 

In XX/XX/XXXX my loan servicing was transferred to Mr Cooper ( Formerly Nationstar Mortgage. ) ( Account # XXXX ). Mr Cooper did do a escrow analysis in XXXX of XXXX. That analysis was completely mishandled and they indicate a shortage of XXXX in my account. Even though my account is currently at a XXXX deficit as of XX/XX/XXXX. Their major errors was their analysis to my Hazard insurance and Morgage insurance. They indicated the Hazard insurance was XXXX last year ( when it was actually XXXX ) and this year the correct amount of XXXX. The Mortgage insurance they again misquoted last year at XXXX ( the actual was XXXX ) and listed this year the correct amount at XXXX so they are showing a difference from last year to this year of XXXX increase. This is totally wrong. They are demanding the difference be paid in a lump sum or have my monthly payment increased to cover the shortage over a year period. I have contacted Mr Cooper by phone on  XX/XX/XXXX and was told someone would look at it but no one from their Escrow will call, just an email. I have also sent a letter stating the error. The new charges will be taking effect in XXXX so something needs to happen quickly. The simple facts are that my Hazard insurance has gone down from XXXX to XXXX. My taxes did go up from XXXX to XXXX, so the net effect of the two is only XXXX. I am already paying one shortage based on XXXX miscalculation and that was to be spread out over 5 years. 
I want both XXXX and Mr Copper to correct the errors made to my escrow account and have XXXX send the deficiency to Mr Cooper post haste. I want Mr Cooper to revise the shortage based on all of this information.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"We have already tried to contact the company with the following complaint 3 times using different avenues. In the most recent email sent, we requested that they contact us to at least acknowledge that the complaint was received. We have gotten no responses since the complaint was first filed three weeks ago. The text of the submitted complaint follows. 

To whom it may concern : We are writing to submit a formal complaint regarding the poor service that we received while working with XXXX XXXX XXXX/Closing Mark Home Loan. We are strongly considering submitting a formal complaint to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and any similar state agency in Colorado and/or California, as we feel that there were instances that pushed the boundaries of acceptable and, possible, legal behavior. 
The entire loan process with this company, from start to finish, has been unprofessional at best to downright deceptive and, potentially, life-impacting. We have been forgotten, lied to, and put into stressful situations that, frankly, should never happen. We have been through multiple account officers and underwriters, been asked to submit documents multiple times, been told falsehoods, and, upon completing closing on XX/XX/XXXX, we received letters that appeared to be informing us that we had been denied for the loan that we closed on. 
The following is a summarized narrative of the timeline from starting the prequalification process to closing on the mortgage. This timeline has been compiled based upon timestamped communication ( both written and digital ). 
We started this journey in XX/XX/2019, upon starting the prequalification process. We submitted the requested information to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( herein after XXXX )  and promptly received a response on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, we received an initial workbook which showed us the expected loan amount, down payment amount, fees, etc. The individual that we started with was extremely responsive and helpful, answering any of our questions promptly and clearly. 
We toured the community and decided that it was a good fit for us. At that time, we were given the option of looking for outside financing options or pursuing financing with the related company, XXXX ; the related financing came with builder incentives. At no point were we pressured by the sales team at XXXX to go with XXXX. However, as we had already started the prequalification process ( and the subsequent hard hit to our credit scores ) and because of the very good service we had received to date, as well as the healthy builder incentive, we signed the sales contract with the commitment to pursue the mortgage through XXXX. The contract was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, following a discussion with both the sales team at XXXX and the XXXX representative. 
On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday ), we reached out to the XXXX representative to see what the next financing steps would be, as the sales team indicated that the mortgage company would reach out to us. The next day ( a Sunday ), the XXXX representative informed us that he would be running an automated approval and would reach out if he needed additional documents. We took this to mean that our application was complete enough to start the clock and was in process. At this point, we had not been told that additional documents would be required to complete our application, just that there may be a need for additional documentation. 
We did not hear back from the XXXX representative after that point. On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday, nearly two full calendar weeks from last contact ), we reached out to the XXXX representative again. By XX/XX/XXXX ( Wednesday ), we emailed the XXXX sales team for assistance ; they referred us to the president of the mortgage company. We were informed, by the president of the company, that the XXXX representative that had been handling our application had abruptly left XXXX and that our application had not been passed onto another case manager/loan officer. By that time, our required loan approval date had passed ; this date was stipulated in our sales contract. 
We were connected with a new XXXX representative ( herein after referred to as new XXXX representative or loan officer ) who informed us via email that our application was incomplete and that nothing had been processed in the intervening time. Again, we had been under the impression that our application was complete and in process since mid-XXXX. At that point, again, nearly two weeks had passed, and we did not receive a formal notification of incompleteness. 
During the subsequent document collection period, the loan officer asked we could put down another half percent, which would increase our down payment to 3.5 % of the sales price. We agreed that we could afford the extra 0.5 %, but asked if she was considering an FHA loan. She informed us that she was looking at that option. At that point, we stated that we did not want to pursue an FHA loan, but said that we would consider it if we could see all the financing options that she could offer us. We asked that we be provided with a worksheet showing all the offerings that we could qualify for, so that we could pick the option that best matched our needs. We never received a product comparison worksheet despite the written request. Additionally, we did not receive an updated worksheet showing our expected costs at this time. 

Subsequently, as we were loading additional documents into the XXXX portal when we noticed that we had a loan details section available. We opened that section of the webpage and saw that our loan had been started under an FHA program, despite the fact that we had told our loan officer that we did not want an FHA loan and despite the fact that we had not been given a worksheet showing our product options. We communicated to the loan officer that we emphatically did not want the FHA loan, as the fees associated with the loan would negate any benefit from going with XXXX, based upon the builder incentives. Additionally, both of us have strong credit scores and did not need the credit support to qualify for a mortgage. Instead of giving us a workbook showing us our different financing options, the loan officer changed the product type for the mortgage to a XXXX  XXXX  conventional loan. Again, at no point were we allowed to select our product type ( or informed that XXXX only offered a limited product selection ). We were not given the information needed to make an informed decision. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the first set of loan disclosure documents ; we were not talked through our product choices at this point. We promptly signed the loan disclosures, after saving a copy and reviewing in detail. At this point, we received our first estimate ( aside from the prequalification estimate provided in XXXX ) that showed our expected loan costs, rate, fees, etc. This information was not provided ahead of time and we were informed that we had only 72 hours to sign the documents. We were not given options on product type or any other factor. Additionally, we were not offered any assistance in understanding the documents that we were given or any help working through the legalese. 

It should be noted that we were informed, only by the disclosures, that the PMI would not be cancellable due to rising home values. At the outset, the original XXXX  representative implied ( though, notably, did not explicitly state ), that the home could be reappraised after a period of time and the new value used for the LTV calculation. Under the subsequent disclosures, it was apparent that the PMI could only cancellable via loan payments compared to the original appraised value at closing. While not a major issue, it is notable because it is contradictory to information that we had at outset. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an automated email informing us that we had updated disclosures to sign. The email did not indicate what the changes were, nor did the loan officer notify us at any point that changes had been made. Upon reviewing the disclosures, the changes were the addition of a TILA form ( that we did not receive in our original packet ), an additional {$200.00} fee, and the removal of our {$5000.00} earnest money deposit. As a result, our updated disclosures indicated that we would owe an additional {$5000.00} in cash for our down payment at closing.

We reached out the same date to the loan officer and received a response that equated to her not knowing what was going on. Upon further research, she informed us that she wasnt sure why the earnest money deposit was removed and that she would make sure that we would get updated documents showing the amount. We were told to be confident that the credit would be given at closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we were introduced via email to a loan processor ( herein after loan processor or underwriter ; this introduction came directly from the loan processor and the loan officer was not involved in the introduction. At this time, the loan processor stated that our loan was conditionally approved, dependent upon two document lists. One list was to be provided as soon as possible, while the other was due within 60 days of closing. At this point, we were at about a month and a half out from the point at which we had been originally led to believe that our application was complete.

Many of the documents requested at this time had already been submitted as part of our original loan package or the subsequent package initiated by the loan officer. We had to resend many of the documents and enter them onto an online portal. 

It should be noted, at this point, we sent images ( pictures ) of several of the documents to the loan processor. This was not an issue and she did not request that the documents be scanned or otherwise in a different format. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we began reaching out to the loan officer to get information for the mortgagee clause, as our insurance agent was requesting it before he could start the formal application and estimate process on his side. The next day, we were informed that a new loan processor ( different from the current underwriter ) would provide that information to our agent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we reached out to the loan processor, as we had not heard from her since we submitted our documents ( largely completed in XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, she responded and said that she received all our documents that that everything looks good at this time. She said that she would reach out closer to closing, but did not state why. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the loan officer informing us that XXXX had acquired Closing Mark Home Loans ( herein after CMHL ) and that our mortgage application would be acquired by CMHL. The email stated that our mortgage would be redisclosed and that we would need to sign updated disclosures. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a notification from CMHL stating that the XXXX mortgage application had been migrated to the new platform. We received new loan disclosures at that time. 

The XX/XX/XXXX letter informed us that we would be receiving an updated conditional approval. This is a month after we had originally been conditionally approved. The loan officer did not reach out to explain that a new application had been started on the new platform, hence the approval process was started over entirely. The document informed us that our application was started XX/XX/XXXX, though it was not explicitly made clear that it was a completely new loan application and not just a formality due to the new system. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the formal scheduling request for closing, via Closing Mark Settlement Services. While this was scheduled, we had not yet received a formal approval, final disclosures, or closing instructions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received 3 options for the interest rate lock. The option sheet was sent only with instructions to look at Options 1, 2 and 3, with no explanation for the calculations, differences, or any other factors. Upon reviewing them, the only option that we could follow the math on was Option 3. Given the previous difficulties in obtaining information from the loan officer, we decided to lock on the option that we could follow. Based on our math, the other two options did not appear to conform to standard amortization at the listed interest rates, but, again, we could not follow the math. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received our updated disclosures for the interest rate lock. This disclosure, like previous disclosures, did not have any charge for points. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the president of the mortgage company. This email informed us that XXXX was legally required to close out the application and that we would soon be receiving a notice from XXXX  that would show that XXXX  no longer had an active application in the system for us ; the email stated that the communication that we would receive could include language stated that the application was denied, but that it would not impact our ongoing application with CMHL. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a Changed Circumstance letter. This letter added a {$770.00} fee, amounting to 0.25 % of the loan amount, as points, as part of the origination costs. This fee was not explained to us. The letter stated that it was due to the credit report/credit score and credit report/mortgage insurance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email titled XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Conditional Loan Approval. This email included a list of new documents to provide, including new disclosures, new bank statements, new paystubs, insurance quote, and college transcripts. It should be noted that we were told, in the body of the email, that the documents needed to be provided asap. At this point, we were not offered a secure way to send our documents. We could email them back to the loan processor directly or fax them. 

At this point, we were also informed that we could not send pictures of documents to the loan processor, despite having been able to send images previously. While navigable, this put a fair amount of undue pressure on us, as we had to find a way to scan our documents to be able to send them via email. We also found that we had a significant amount of pressure from the loan processor to provide the documents quickly On XX/XX/XXXX, we received disclosures to sign. On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed the loan officer and asked if the disclosures were the final set and if the listed cash to close amount was the amount we needed to get our cashiers check for closing. We were informed that the disclosures given were the final set. 

The XX/XX/XXXX documents additionally included a waiver for the receipt of the appraisal within the timing required by ECOA section 1002.14 ( a ) ( 1 ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the appraisal on the property. This property appraisal had been completed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed our loan officer to ask about what name to put on the cashiers check for closing, as we never received closing instructions. While this email was sent on a Saturday, we had previously received prompt responses from all parties, even on weekends. We had no reason to believe that we would not hear back prior to closing on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We received no further communication from the mortgage company, nor any of its agents, prior to closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we closed on the mortgage. Our appointment to close was at XXXX. We arrived at approximately XXXX, as our previous meeting for the day had ended more quickly than expected. We were prepared to wait until XXXX. Our closing agent came out at around XXXX and told us that our application had not yet been approved by CMHL and that she was, as a result, still, waiting for documents. She also informed us that she had not yet received the final closing disclosure and that, as a result, our cash to close amount had not yet ben finalized. 

At about XXXX, our closing agent informed us that she had received several closing disclosures for our application that day. She then stated that the final closing amount had been set by CMHL, as she had confirmed the most recent disclosure with the wire processor. We were short on our original check ( which was stated as the final amount, as previously noted ) and were forced to go back to our bank. We had to come up with about {$800.00} on the spot to be able to close. At this point, our closing documents were not yet available. 

We signed our documents at our XXXX PM on XX/XX/XXXX. We waited at the settlement office until nearly XXXX XXXX for the final wire to be sent by the processing agent. We were given no explanation for the significant wait. 

After closing, we returned to our then-current residence for the night. We checked our mail. We found two letters which were mailed to us ( one for each of us ), which stated that our loan had been denied. The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, but had not been mailed and post-marked until XX/XX/XXXX. These letters were related to the hand-off from XXXX to CMHL. As previously noted, we had been told in XXXX that we may receive a formal denial letter, due to the new application being opened. As given by the discrepancy between the letter and postmark dates, it appears that these letters were held back for some reason. The reason was not given to us at any point in the application process. 

The following day, XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from our loan officer apologizing for the delay in response to our question regarding our closing and a statement that she hoped our closing went okay. No comments were included regarding the fact that our loan had not been approved for the day of closing. We did not respond. 

In summary, the entire process was fraught and full of miscommunications and a lack of communication. Our grievances are summarized below : Our application was forgotten by the mortgage company, as the original representative left and nobody picked up his caseload. 
Our application was implied to have been complete and in process with the original representative. 
o At no point did we receive a formal notice of incompleteness, despite ongoing requests for information over several months. 
o We were not given a complete checklist of all the information that we would need to provide throughout the life of the application and approval process. 
We were not given product comparisons between available options, despite multiple requests for such information. 
We were originally put into a product type that we explicitly stated that we did not want. 
o While we do not know the details of the XXXX/CMHL compensation structure, we have been informed by multiple individuals from outside financial institutions that FHA loans often generate a larger incentive fee for the loan officer. We believe that this could be the reason for the initial assignment.

We were given contradictory information throughout the process. This includes receiving documents which did not include {$5000.00} in cash we had already paid ; while this was resolved, this issue was never explained to us.

We were not given explanations for multiple adjustments and changes to fees and amounts through out the process.

o Our loan officer did not make any attempt to explain any of the forms, procedures, or documents that we received. We were forced to make our best attempt at understanding the files that we had to sign. 
o When setting our rate lock, the loan officer did not explain the difference between the given options. As previously stated, two of the options did not mathematically calculate to the payments given.

o We are better informed than most consumers, as one of us works for a commercial bank. Even then, we had trouble with some of the documents and it is baffling that we received no guidance from the loan officer.

We were denied a secure way to send documents to the loan processor.

o Additionally, a format which had previously been acceptable for files, was no longer acceptable. We were not given an explanation for this discrepancy. 
We were not given closing instructions. When we reached out for instructions ( admitted at the 11th hour ), we did not receive a response. This is out of line with prior behavior, as we had previously received prompt communication even outside of normal business hours. 
o The response from the lender was given a business day after our closing. It should be noted that this response did not include any of the requested information. 
Our loan was not approved prior to the day of our closing and, in actuality, we had to wait for the application to be approved and for documents to be prepared and sent to our closing agent. 
o While we are not sure of the industry standard for loan approvals and preparation of loan documents for mortgages, it does not seem unreasonable to expect that the process should be completed well prior to the day of closing. 
o This caused a significant amount of personal stress, as our closing agent could not give us an expected timeline. We were left unaware of if we were going to be able to close on our scheduled date or if we would need to be rescheduled. 
This is significant, as we had already made arrangements for our moving process, including cancelling our lease with our prior residence, booking and prepaying for moving equipment, and taking time off from work ( including taking time for the day of closing itself ). 
We received a formal loan denial after our closing, with the denial letters being sent on XX/XX/XXXX. Given that XX/XX/XXXX was a holiday, it seems likely that the letters were sent so as to not be received until after closing. 
o The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, which means that the letters were held back for well over a month. While we are not sure on the required disclosure timelines for consumer loans, we have been informed that it is often 10 days from the decision date. This delivery falls well outside of that window.","ClosingMark Financial Services, LLC",CO,802XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..","TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,327XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I have been trying to get my Private Mortgage Insurance Removed from my mortgage since XX/XX/XXXX when my mortgage dropped below 80 % loan to value. Last year my mortgage was sold from XXXX XXXX  ( Under mortgage # XXXX ) to Ditech Mortgage ( account # XXXX ). I reached out to Ditech via a email ( after being told to do so via phone representative ) request to remove my PMI on mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX and received no response at all from them, I even checked my junk box and nothing was there. My mortgage papers that I signed state an "" Automatic Termination of PMI '' that states once my loan is below 78 % loan to value PMI will automatically terminate ( I have attached this document ). I reached out again today on XX/XX/XXXX to make this request via phone and was told initially to send the request that I already sent it too. I asked to speak with a supervisor and after being put on hold for about 30 minutes, I finally spoke to one. They told me that my loan to value must be under 70 % loan to value and that was their policy. After reading this document to the supervisor, I was told that "" they don't have that document on file ''. She ( XXXX XXXX ) sent me a link to send her the form I have. I did so and just told me that I'll be hearing from them in 7-10 business days. Given their past history, I highly doubt that I will hear from them. I did mention to the supervisor and ask her why they weren't staying compliant to the homeowners protection act and she said nothing. From my understand this act requires mortgage companies to drop off PMI once loans are below 78 % LTV and the loan is current. I qualify for both of those items and don't understand why this is such a difficult task.",Ditech Financial LLC,TX,781XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

My name is XXXX XXXX and I was XXXX yrs old at the time and a college student. My mom & I sat down as I returned from college and pulled my credit report. Discovered after pulling the Free Annual Credit Report that another person, XXXX XXXX  XXXX, and a car loan & credit card that were not mine were on my credit report. It should be noted it was only on XXXX. We contacted XXXX & Wells Fargo bank to report the fraudulent accounts. They did confirm it was my SS # on file but with someone elses name, DOB, and address. We filled out fraud forms, send police report number, and copies of credit reports. On XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX I received letters from both Wells Fargo & XXXX stating it was discovered to be identity theft and they would have the 3 credit bureaus remove from my credit file. I also placed a freeze on my credit files. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a few voicemails from SS office stating my identity may have been compromised yet again. I pulled credit reports again and was shocked to see XXXX  is reporting my file as XXXX XXXX XXXX, his DOB, Addresses, XXXX XXXX is running inquiries ( I dont have ), Wells Fargo credit card is showing closed as of XX/XX/XXXX, last payment XX/XX/XXXX, shows consumer disputes, and last reported XX/XX/XXXX. None of this is mine and was to be removed. 

This person is clearly using my SS # according to XXXX & Wells Fargo. XXXX did their job and removed it for Fraud. Wells Fargo has not. How did a large national bank such as Wells Fargo allow someone to open a credit card in my name without the proper verification. Clearly the other persons name and DOB ( XX/XX/XXXX ) does not match my SS #. Where is the verification on that? They allowed someone to use falsified documents and did not follow verification procedures. I am only XXXX yrs old and have been a victim of identity theft by 2 large companies.

The email read The final pay off amount for XXXX, XXXX will be {$86000.00} This information is provided by XXXX XXXX on XXXX. It was emailed from XXXX. The subject line read Re : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Payoff amount for XXXX and insurance info.The insurance info was a single page showing coverage of {$77000.00} on a single story dwelling from a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX listing my home address and XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , as registered agent. XXXX XXXX was the insured. I responded to that email disagreeing with the amount and asked for some sort of statement of accounting because XXXX XXXX was asking for more than the {$85000.00} financed and I had made payments for 5 years and 7 months consecutively. She responded with just saying no she was correct. On or around XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney In Fact for a XXXX XXXX mailed me a Notice of substitute trustee sale The notice had a sale date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX A date of XX/XX/XXXX An amount of {$95000.00} Borrower XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Collateral : All of Debtors interest in the real property legal described as : XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX according to the map and plat there of recorded in the Deed Anns Plat Records XXXX County , Texas . The Note section is blank. This is dated XX/XX/XXXX and has a file stamp of XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX County Records. XXXX XXXX never lended me any money. I was the only person providing money in the purchase of my home. I was in a TREC   contract with XXXX XXXX for my home. It was already signed by us both for the home {$85000.00} financed for 360 months no balloon payment ; until I received XX/XX/XXXX closing documents showing a balloon payment due XXXX XXXX, payments of {$850.00} every month/ {$600.00} being the house payment and the other being taxes. I am wanting to see the bank statements and escrow accounting for the time period of XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX, XXXX and the payment records for taxes, and all transfer records. And the proof that XXXX XXXX has showing {$95000.00} going from her hand to mine. I want to see the substitute trustee recorded appointment and I want to see proof of XXXX XXXX identity. I want to see the accounting for the down payment made on the property and proof she owned the property when she sold it to me. 
When I obtained legal representation and stopped the sale date, another debt collection letter came dated XX/XX/XXXX for a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. This notice contains all the same information as the previous notice except it is listing XXXX XXXX name first above XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney in fact at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX , Texas . After firing the first attorney hired after the discovery of {$21000.00} in receipts missing from my receipts of payments to XXXX XXXX a new hired attorney chose to conspire with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and in the printed emails left in my file that were my attorney and XXXX XXXX Attorney planning and executing the sale of my home they had agreed on the figures that XXXX will have the HUD 1 payoff Mr Cooper and XXXX loans paid in full their ( your, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) further states there is a first and second on this property Mr Cooper total payoff by XXXX XXXX {$47000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX payoff is {$13000.00} subtotal {$60000.00} BUT again there is language of a loan between XXXX and I in an amount said to be {$78000.00} and Mr. XXXX took the liberty of adding Attorney fees of {$5000.00} making a total of {$83000.00} these documents were emailed back and forth plan discussed of running it through the uncontested docket, signed by a judge, filed in the court records, being fully executed. But I never received any documentation of this sale. I am requesting / demanding the pay off accounting and statements and a copy of the HUD1.

Now I am needing to have the documentation and explanation of how my home was sold, if it wasnt is it fraud on the court? And AGAIN I receive another notice of substitute trustee sale dated XX/XX/XXXX this time the amounts are base amount due as maturity : {$88000.00} / unpaid principle past maturity ( 18 % ) {$34000.00} / subtotal {$120000.00} / Attorney Fees XXXX / Cost {$120.00} / Total due XX/XX/XXXX {$130000.00} It continues to read : please contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for current payoff instructions at my address above please be advised if this payment is not received by XXXX the mortgagee will exercise the rights under the loan documents and foreclose the loan at public sale, Tuesday, XXXX, XXXX at XXXX.

Now I want to know how you, XXXX XXXX XXXX or and XXXX XXXX can act as an Attorney in fact and harass me for months, years inducing lawsuits when an attorney in fact is not allowed to handle assets held in trust? How can you impose a debt on me of {$130000.00} and state you will respond to my letter of validation when you did not. Mailing me copies of public record court papers and passed made up accounting graphs from your home computer is not accounting. I want to see the reasoning on how you decided I owed this last mentioned notice and the removal of trustee documents recorded. You stated in this debt collection letter you would reveal the original creaditor upon my request and you did not.I mailed to you by certified letter and I faxed you the same validation letter but you not XXXX XXXX responded until I received again a substitute trustee sale notice this time 2 in the same envelope? dated XX/XX/XXXX And XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating I owe {$130000.00} and contains debt collection language but you are threatening to sell my home ...., you already did once. On XX/XX/XXXX you sold my home to XXXX XXXX for a credit bid of {$88000.00}.? I want all tax certificates and the deed of trust back I want all XXXX XXXX XXXX accounting and I want copies of all the escrow account. I want copies of proof you owned my home when you sold it to me XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
I demand documented proof that you obtained a legal confessed judgement by me. I demand documentation of the mortgage loan you have repeatedly made demands for payment of and of the investment contract you are holding / have held me liable for that I am not a party that is the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Statue of Frauds was made to prevent the very thing you have been doing to me. See UCC at 2-201. You have made me an undisclosed third party to a loan modification ; to a contract I am not a party to. This is why you have never been able to show my payments going to a servicing company you are sending them as cash flow to the investors. You kept using the term mortgage in your debt collection letters but a note is a security as you know, this was undisclosed to me along with a disclaimer that was supposed to be in the credit application under Title 16 16 car 433.2 which says the buyer/seller takes it subject to all defenses and claims that the buyer could assert against any transferee or any buyer who buys it. But you Took it out of the loan application. So there is no holder in due course meaning you take it subject to my claims and defenses I am claiming recoupment under UCC 3-305 under UCC 3-306 I am encoring my proprietary and possession art and property interest in the note and its proceds. Also I am encoring my right to rescind the endorsement on the note. The rider XXXX XXXX made the wrap around deed of trust with modifies the conditions of payment and supplements and governs the promissory note. UCC 3-106 ( D ) it cant be negotiated instrument if it is subject or governed by extraneous documents outside the promissory note and you made it subject to an adjustable rate Ryder and a deed of trust. You can not collect an alleged debt on what you call a mortgage and sell someones property when it is not a note or a negotiable interest. It has a maturity longer than nine months making it a security. I am encoring my right to claim under UCC 3-306 the proceeds, rescuind the negotiation, and am claiming my possessionary and property right in the proceeds in the investment contract.

How did I go from being a student on a promissory note, to now the sole borrower? I have called XXXX, and it has been unsuccessful. I have requested documents including the denial letter stating why the loan wasnt forgiven as a result of my father 's death, the promissory note they have on file, as well as the loan terms indicating that I am now legally responsible for this loan.

Our mortgage payment at the time of purchase, with the principle, interest and estimated taxes was XXXX. We have a VA loan of 30 year fixed. 
On or around XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and I refinanced our home with our current mortgage company, to an interest rate of 3.25 % ( previously at 4.875 % ). 
The new payment was sent to us at XXXX, of which we have been paying on time, every month since XXXX of XXXX. 
I received a statement that our escrow account was at a shortage and we would now be required to pay XXXX for 12 months, until the shortage is made up and then the payment would be XXXX moving forward. I called them and they explained the refinance dept used the taxes from when there was no property built on the land and now it has been reassessed. My problem is they made a huge error because our loan was sold to them, and the estimated taxes we were paying in that previous payment were correct, and the loan officer who re-financed us either was not paying attention or because he wanted us to refi with this current lender, provided the wrong information and included it in our loan. Also, my husband was told by one of the representatives at the current mortgage, that our taxes had been raised and that was the reason for the increase. I called the county assessors office and was told our taxes had only increased by XXXX dollars and that the mortgage company had made the error and was not willing to admit it.

Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I am filing this complaint after receiving a letter from Chase today alleging a lie to cover up their illegal activities. In the letter ( see attachment ) dated XX/XX/XXXX Chase asserted that we cant consider you for mortgage assistance because we didnt receive your initial request by the required number of days before the scheduled foreclosure date. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE. I REPEAT. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE, AND I CAN PROVE IT! 
Chase has repeatedly made false allegations like this to us for more than four years. Most of the Chase Request for Mortgage Assistance applications we have sent to Chase have been ignored ( see attachment ). Nonetheless, In XX/XX/XXXX, our Chase dedicated relationship manager in XXXX, Florida spoke to the Chase branch bank manager and vice president in XXXX, Georgia. He ( the vice president ) told her ( our dedicated relationship manager ) that he personally faxed all of our documents to her the previous week and confirmed their receipt in her office at that time. In spite of this fact, she requested through the branch bank vice president that we submit our application and all required documents to her again for the 33rd time in 18 months ( see attachment ). Consequently, our dedicated relationship manager sent to our home address a XXXX envelope for us to submit our application and documents back to her again. We sealed the documents in that envelope and took it back to the Chase branch bank so that Chase employees could send it to her through XXXX. 
The Chase branch bank in XXXX, Georgia took receipt of our envelope of documents and gave them to XXXX. XXXX tracking confirms that our application was received by our dedicated relationship manager in her actual office on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( see attachment ). After that date, we never heard from our dedicated relationship manager again regarding ANY aspect of our application. 
Chase proceeded in XXXX to schedule a foreclosure on our property for XX/XX/XXXX in violation of the laws of our state for multiple reasons, including failure to provide proper notification as required by law. As such, this proves the statement made by Chase to us in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX is a lie because we submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance application to Chase more than thirty days before Chase took illegal action to attempt a foreclosure on the date of XX/XX/XXXX. Our "" dedicated relationship manager '' failed to process our application despite our having previously submitted it to her in XX/XX/XXXX, and well as on 32 previous occasions in the past 18 months.",JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,GA,305XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

I have lost 4 months of work and have even been rescheduling in the Fall and losing my remaining good Saturdays for the year. So I will not be making up that money. I filed for unemployment, but because I am XXXX and work in 2 states ( XXXX XXXX area strattles state line ), I was told I had to call in. The call line sends you to a machine which hangs up on you after directing you back online because they are swamped. So I said I only work in Kansas in order to submit it, but no response or check yet. 

We have XXXX  kids and a new home we bought in XXXX of 2019. Our mortgage company is Mr. Cooper. We have missed 2 payments of roughly {$1800.00} each, XXXX and XXXX, so far. I have tried calling, but they also have an automated message directing you back to online and hanging up afterward. But then I discover the only option is a forbearance, admittedly warning I may be disqualified from any stimulus or other aid if I fill it out. On top of that, they say quite sternly XXXX and repeated bluntly by the CEO in a video ) that it is NOT an extension of the life of the loan, but rather a normal extension, requiring a lump sum at the end of the 90 days. As if anyone is saving money right now and able to pay MORE when this nightmare is over! Thats illogical. It is mentioned that payment plans could be made, but this is not what you agree to in the application and it is so arbitrary it is unknown exactly what they could force you to do after agreeing to this form. This seems unwise to enter into. So for these terms, and the threat of not getting aid, I chose not to fill this out. I did however email them explaining this. I have not heard back and they are still not taking calls. 

We can not lose our home. And we can not pay a higher monthly payment. We are scared and dont know how to fix this. Meanwhile, the days are passing by and notices are flooding in. We have been able to pay all our other bills, but that will end this month if unemployment or a stimulus doesnt come soon. 

If anyone can encourage mortgage companies to extend the life of loans, it would help us immensely. I can only imagine how many people are being hurt by filling out this forbearance, which essentially gives zero aid, and only allows for a little time to then make their account current all at once, without any backpay to do so. It seems dishonest and taking advantage of many people forced to choose this only option.

Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Cashing a check,"Capital One mailed me a closeout check on or around XX/XX/XXXX, received on XX/XX/XXXX, deposited to my XXXX XXXX account on XX/XX/XXXX. Capital One chose to place a stop payment prematurely on the check and in error, they will not admit to this error plainly, will rather state "" Expectations not set correctly '' as reason for stop payment. A second check was expedited via XXXX second day air and rep ( s ) did not allow enough mail time for prior check before reissuing and thus stopping payment.. The check amount, XXXX, represents the remaining balance in my checking account ending in XXXX. Replacement check was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. I left for XXXX XXXX on this day, was not at my address to receive/sign for it or sign check itself. 

XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX picked me up, drove me to XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I have a statement from Mr XXXX stating he picked me up on said date and time. Please see attached document from Mr XXXX, he can be reached at XXXX. I was in XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. 

I received information from a XXXX with leadership team at Capital One stating said check was intercepted and signed by a XXXX XXXX whom does not live here, cashed at a XXXX XXXX XXXX which is not my account and do not bank there. A XXXX XXXX with Capital One has replied in re about this, stating the person, XXXX XXXX, lives at my address and the XXXX XXXX Bank account is or was linked to my Capital One account at some point. She also refers to a check deposited to my account from this person sometime ago. My account is now closed and It appears Capital One chose to close it due to account security, they saw the linked account, which I am not aware of, as a possible risk. It appears someone had hacked into my account at some point, added XXXX XXXX account and also used my account to cash a check in the past. Neither of these two incidents are related to loss of funds or constitute receipt of them. 

If Capital One will check signatures on check received on XX/XX/XXXX and replacement check delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, they will see signatures are different from another. Also, another check from Capital One covering overdraft and return check fees relating to stop payment shows my true and correct signature, as does the check received on XX/XX/XXXX which was deposited to my XXXX account and is now closed due to overdrawn status. The overdraft is a result of Capital One stopping payment prematurely as stated prior. I've requested Capital One check signatures, XXXX XXXX did not comply. For argument sake and figuratively speaking even if the person, XXXX XXXX, is related, does not mean funds were not stolen from me as they in fact were..

I request someone in office of the President look into this matter which has been ongoing since late XX/XX/XXXX/early XX/XX/XXXX. To avoid investigating signatures as requested, Capital One chooses to mark complaints as duplicate to avoid doing so. They requested additional time to reply to a prior complaint, which took over a month and then turned around, marked it as duplicate.",CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CT,6320,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..","TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,328XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

They returned results that stated "" all information correct and verified with reporting company ''. I then did a little research on how to have errors removed from your credit report, as well as spoke to an attorney that advised me to send certified letters to both companies asking that the accounts be verified with proof of that verification. One company ( A collection Agency ) refused the letter, the other sent me a response that said they had verified the information with the credit bureaus and was not required to provide any proof to me other than they verified my identity on this credit card ON-LINE. So apparently crooks don't open accounts on-line???!!! 
So I filed WRITTEN disputes to all three Credit Bureaus, sent them all Certified Mail, and just received a response from XXXX stating once again regarding the same account - "" Information verified with reporting agency '' and nothing more. That's it??? Of course the reporting agency is going to "" confirm '' that their information is correct, but don't they need to provide some sort of PROOF other than their word?!!!!!

Probably because of that, I am only keeping my score to be good although, I feel, according to my assets ; it should always be excellent. 
Anyhow, my referral website is XXXX and Equifax as the information sources about the score and changes in it. 
Recently, I needed some fresh money to pay legal services for litigation in XXXX to collect debt created by a piracy of my IP by XXXX. 
I asked for Line-of-Credit several creditors, but I always was convinced by them that their requests will not damage my score very much. It was true. 
Surprisingly, just before the Holiday vacation, I noticed that XXXX score has changed for 95 points. It went down from XXXX ( good ) to XXXX ( poor ). The only contact I had was on the day of score reduction ( XX/XX/2018) with a XXXX XXXX  representative who used his resources to check my score. This change has immediately decreased my options to loan some money by certified creditors and, to remedy this status, I called XXXX for the explanation. 
They kindly explained that they obtain information from credit bureaus and that this change happened on Equifax in response to some inquiry by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, or XXXX XXXX - -located in Colorado at XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX , CO XXXX ) The XXXX XXXX confirmed that XXXX XXXX is their source of combined information from all three registered and legally approved credit bureaus Equifax , XXXX and XXXX   . XXXX XXXX obviously is not an authorized provider of credit information. 
I was appalled because I do not know who and what is that company, I never got in touch with them, never asked them for a loan, and never have given any authorization to them ; less to manipulate my score credit reports. 
Suddenly, from the blues, somebody has ruined my credibility. 
Somebody else must be responsible for these fraudulent actions. But who? 
I called Equifax. The CS was not able to give me an answer, but the Supervisor asked me to pay ( which I did ) and to expect my Equifax score on mail reported in 5-7 business days. It happened never before. I always received the simple answer. 
I tried to file a dispute at Equifax, but since the XXXX XXXX have not mentioned any account, I could not even file that this account is not mine. The complaint went to the customer comment box. 
I checked XXXX XXXX website ( XXXX ) and found a computer data company which is collecting and selling data from companies and individuals. I called XXXX XXXX again and they confirmed that they work with XXXX XXXX and that they were in touch regarding my score just in the time my score was changed. Since I did not give authorization to XXXX XXXX to share my information with any third party, like XXXX XXXX, I think they must share the responsibility for reducing my score for 96 points in a couple of hours after being in the good range. 
I do not recall that any Federal regulation is giving authority to anybody to check the personal credit score without the prior written permission. Somebody, in this case, a representative from XXXX XXXX, has given permission to XXXX XXXX to re-score information on my credit, or they did it without permission. I I think, this is a violation of FDCPA and FCRA, both under FTC/CFPB jurisdiction and this why I am writing this complaint.","EQUIFAX, INC.",MD,208XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

They were saying that I owe about {$18000.00} and respond us back urgent. They called me mulitple times and send me a letter that if i don't respond back they will treat it as confirmed debt and will make me liable. I called them and nobody picked up and i left them 2 to 3 times voicemail that please send everything in writing do not call as I am practicing the Fairness act of Debt collections. 
Anyway i send them a detailed letter as followed below in text. 

Bilateral Credit Collection XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, RI XXXX XXXX : Account No : XXXX To Whom It May Concern I do not consent to this debt and I totally dispute the validity of the debt in the above-reference account number # XXXX and would like verification from you of the obligation, the amount owed, and proof of a detailed valid assignment of the debt from the original creditor to you. I request everything to be send in written format and no phone calls or text messages. Please send me copies of all documents related to this dispute including along with the following questions answered. 
Q1 : Who you are you? Who do you represent? provide me a detailed contract copy if you are representing the original Creditor? Provide the facts and proof that you are the original representation?

Q2 : What is your direct number and what is the actual company headquarter address?

Q3 : What is your professional license information? Also are you registered in Washington state to send the dispute details as per law? As you are based out of state most probably you have to take retain local counsel?

Q4 : What was your process of getting the debt from the original creditor? what detailed information you asked or obtained? What was your verification process if it was actually a debt or a dispute? if you did not comply with the law to gather proper evidence of the claim disputes, you are already violating the law time.

Q 5 : Before sending the verification of the dispute, did you really investigated on your side what was the core issue why this all happened? 
Q 4 : Provide all the documents account records, invoices of claims and correspondence on what specific date?

Q5 : How you come up with this {$18000.00} amount and what is the breakdown of these charges?

Q6 : Based on my knowledge, Debt collectors signed a contract with the original creditor either on a commission basis or buy the debt for pretty cheap amount? By law and fairness Debt Collection Practices Act, you are supposed to provide all that information? How much was the actual amount you bought the debt or dispute for? Is there any documentation/ contract between you and the original creditor. 
Q7 : How can you seek verification and validation of the debt?

I am also exercising my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C 1692, and demand that you cease all communication except with me, my family members and all other third persons. Also you have violated the law of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, by calling multiple times on different dates to pressurize and threaten about the debt when I left a voice message and left a message to one of your agent not to call on my number. Please send me all things in written. 
You are here by notifies that if you do not comply with this request, I will immediately file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and to the State Attorney General 's Office. If you are not able to provide the answer to the above questions and proper researched verification of the dispute within 15 to 30 days of time then you are violating the FDCPA detailed Civil and criminal claims will be pursued.

I can not pay this debt as I do not consent and I do not validate this debt to be considered as a debt. I am already going through financial hardship, medical issues myself and for my family, and on top of this bilateral Credit collection continues calls and violated the law when even told not to call back that have put more pressure and created more stress environment for myself. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX They still called me and last time threaten me to take action against me and report my credit collection right away which they did not. About 2 to 3 weeks passed, then now i have received one more letter from them to call them urgently to resolve as they tried to resolve this case. First of all, I disputed and they failed to provide me with the proof and validity and their connection with the original creditor. They threaten me also voilated by calling me multiple times then it stopped but last time they called when i clearly mentioned al communication in written as my right. Then they started bashing out and said you are this and threaten to take action. funny thing is that there employees can not take control of this small small tasks, how come a company owner saying i am the owner and i do all the work lol it is funny to me, that means the workers are stupid and not capable of handling an danswering and resolving and seeing the case. Why the owner of the company will do basic paper work job and call like a customer service that is strange to me. They also have mishandling and putting false claims on other people and there are reports on betterbusiness burea. Anyway i have my proof of recording of leaving them message to just send everything in written and they still voilated it. Also I have the recording of the person who said I am the owner and i will report it right away and shut the phone and was not even listening.They need to know they have to pay for the compensation and my waste of time if they plan to drag it further. Also they need to stop this immediately otherwise I will report them.","Bilateral Credit Corp, LLC",WA,980XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

They basically explained that even though the last payment of {$26.00} was not due until several days after it was received ( I paid it before the due date ), the 12 months no interest program expired a few days before the payment was actually due. So basically I got charged over {$570.00} for a {$26.00} final payment that was paid early. I have excellent credit and strive to always pay my bills on time.

Then 2-3 weeks later, I would get more mail stating I was failing to make regular monthly payments on my loan to BBVA. 
I once again, called and talked to a representative over the phone. Same thing. They said it was taken care of. 
In XX/XX/2018, I finally went into a local BBVA bank and said I wanted to speak to someone in charge and find out why my payments were not being submitted and why the auto withdrawal was not going thru. After 5 days, it was finally straightened out. BBVA apparently had the wrong account number from my bank. I had submitted it correctly, but they kept entering one too many digits.

Mortgage,VA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"My wife and I were trying to build a new home in XX/XX/2018. We contacted USAA and were assigned a mortgage agent named XXXX XXXX. From the very beginning we informed XXXX that we wanted to construct a new home. We also informed him that we have a POA which allows me to collect my wifes income for the purpose of paying and obtaining new debts. The POA is a general durable POA which names me as my wifes official payee to collect all of her income as if it were my own. ( Since putting the POA in place, I have been able to pay down my wifes debt and raise her credit scores quickly ). We spoke with XXXX about our unique income situation on recorded calls several times. We discussed our hesitation to apply for a loan unless our POA would be recognized and our income would be recognized as my own. My wife and I are both XXXX veterans and receive VA XXXX income. My wife is XXXX XXXX XXXX and recieves more VA income than me. We also work part time as independent contractors for food delivery services for extra income. After emailing our VA XXXX award letter amounts and POA to his email we were verbally informed over the phone that he would have his underwriters and attorney review the POA and whether our income would be recognized as my own. After some time we received verbal confirmation that documents were shown to the underwriters and attorney and that there wasnt a problem with the POA. My wife and I then decided to get preapproved and look for a home. USAA and XXXX XXXX ran our credit and preapproved us for {$180000.00}. At this point, in XX/XX/2018, we informed him that we were interested in building a home. We found a property and travelled to its location to make sure the property was as advertised online and that we wanted to live there. We found out that we needed to use a contractor that has a VA builder ID. We found one. We emailed XXXX the VA builder ID for our contractor. We were told by the owner of the property that we needed to put earnest money down on the vacant land in the amount of XXXX $ and that we would have to hire civil engineers to create a lot exhibit and residential land survey. We paid {$360.00} for the land survey and {$120.00} for the lot exhibit. We also had to travel from Illinois to South Dakota to meet with VA contractor twice to discuss where the best location to build the home would be and to draft up the instruction contract estimate for XXXX XXXX. At this point, XXXX had recieved all documents and knew exactly what our intentions were. In good faith we shared all this information with XXXX and send him emails informing him that the cost would be closer to {$200000.00}. XXXX informed us that the borrowed amount could be increased. I asked again if our income and POA were going to be okay and was verbally told on a recorded line that it looked okay and that our income was okay. We paid the engineers and the earnest money to the seller. When it came time to apply for the mortgage, I was told on the phone that USAA doesnt do construction loans I would have to find a construction loan. This was a shock for my wife and I because he knew from the beginning that we were constructing a home and we had already provided him with our contractors VA builder ID. My wife and I were referred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by our VA contractor. After speaking XXXX XXXX at XXXX, we were told that they were not going to give us a loan or recognize our POA for income. This was XX/XX/2018 and one month before closing. My wife and I asked WHY our POA was not being honored and XXXX refused to put into writing why they were discriminating our POA. They stopped answering our calls and we lost the property. My wife and I were devastated. We had already lost {$1000.00} from travel and civil engineering expenses. Our preapproval expired on XX/XX/XXXX. My wife and I feel that we were mislead from the very beginning because he knew that we were building a home and he told us that USAA doesnt fund construction loans. 
XXXX said we could find an existing home instead but our preapproval expired XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX we found a different home and made an offer on XX/XX/XXXX. We contacted the realtor and put {$1000.00} earnest money down the new house we found. We paid {$300.00} for the home inspection and {$180.00} for the radon test. We also found home insurance and changed insurance companies to satisfy the closing. XXXX said that we had to suffer ANOTHER hard inquiry in order to process our mortgage application. My wife and I were very upset about this because we had already suffered a hard inquiry for the preapproval. Before this whole process my scores were XXXX XXXX and XXXX. We were told by one of XXXX underwriters that the application itself was hard inquiry. And we were forced to run our credit again if we wanted to purchase the home and submit the loan. I told the underwriter my concerns over the recorded phone call that I didnt want to submit to another credit check unless everything else with our application was okay ie : the POA and our imcome. The underwriter said that he couldnt do anything unless we filled out the mortgage application. I recieved a call from XXXX and I asked about underwriting and the POA. He informed me over the phone that everything was looked at by his office attorney and that the POA was good and our income was good. We suffered another hard inquiry credit check. After the credit check, I recieved my credit scores in the mail and an email stating that his underwriters were not recognizing my wifes income. I was shocked AGAIN because from the very beginning he recieved our POA and our VA award letters. His office had these documents since XX/XX/XXXX and it was now XX/XX/2018 and two weeks before closing. We were denied our mortgage and are in danger of losing this property as well. We feel that he dragged out this process unlawfully and wasnt truthful about showing his underwriters the POA prior to this process because I recieved a phone call from one of the underwriters stating I couldnt claim my wifes income. I feel that this office acted unlawfully by telling us different information over the phone to make my wife and I feel that everything was okay when Im fact they were not recognizing my income or the POA because the direct deposited checks have my wifes name on them and she wasnt on the loan due to her credit score even though we had be assured by XXXX verbally for months that the POA to claim my wifes income was okay. We are now in danger of losing this home TOO because of gross misconduct by XXXX XXXX and his XXXX office. My wife and I are in danger of losing this home and an additional {$480.00} on top of the {$1000.00} in damages we already suffered from the previous construction property. My wife and I have submitted every document requested by XXXX and his office, answered all questions asked of us truthfully and to the best of our ability and paid all money to all parties involved in good faith and based off of the information given to us by XXXX XXXX and his office. 
I am attaching a copy of the POA which has been in his offices possesion since XX/XX/2018. Its 9 pictures in order of each page of the POA. I am also enclosing copies of the contractor invoices.",UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,IL,605XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A
Credit card,,Other,,"I was stupid enough to charge some items at MACY 'S on my Macy 's credit card over XXXX. I was unable to log into my account online to make the payment because Macy 's had updated the system and I simply did n't have the patience to navigate their irritating and obscure system. However, I called Macy 's and paid my bill for $ XXXX a day or two late - was assured that there would be no late charges because I was a customer in good standing, yada yada, and received a confirmation number that I had paid the bill in full. 

I then received a bill for {$2.00} in interest. OK, I agree - I had n't paid the {$140.00} on time, regardless of the reason. Whatever. So I paid that {$2.00} bill immediately, by check, and left the country for an extended absence - in complete confidence that I had paid all my bills in full. 

Imagine my surprise when I returned to the US and found that Macy 's had received and cashed my check, but charged me a further {$2.00} anyway as a minimum interest charge on the interest charge that had been paid in full, well before the due date. Oh, and then added a further minimum {$2.00} charge for a total of {$4.00}, due on XXXX. 

I called Macy 's right away and spoke to one XXXX, who did n't seem to have a clue why I was irritated, but eventually - very grudgingly and with full implication that I was a total deadbeat - agreed that she would "" waive '' the {$4.00}. 

Imagine my FURTHER surprise when I received a FURTHER email from Macy 's about my "" account balance. '' I immediately called, went through endless voice prompts, and finally got through to a live human being who said in hushed tones that she 'd have to put me through to another department. 

Sure enough, I got the "" this is an attempt to collect a debt '' speech. The glorious XXXX, according to the faultlessly polite CS rep who answered, had failed to properly credit my account. He agreed that he could correct it and that my account would update eventually to show a {$0.00} balance. However, he was unable to reassure me that this, um, "" delinquency '' had not been reported to the credit bureaux that make a darn good living off selling my info, and he could not send me a letter saying that Macy 's had made a mistake. Given that the glorious XXXX had also assured me that I had a {$0.00} balance on my Macy 's charge card, forgive me if I 'm not confident that I do in fact now have a {$0.00} balance. 

I do not give a flying whatever about my credit as I am old and cranky and do n't need any credit. I DO care that Macy 's total incompetence and the Macy 's system that is set up to fail, to their benefit and to consumers ' detriment, affects kids and other people who DO need good credit.","CITIBANK, N.A.",NC,286XX,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"In XX/XX/2018 for about 10 months I made my daughter an authorized user of my account. Before doing so Barclay Card assured me that she could be a user and that it would have no impact on her credit. Only I was responsible for all charges on the account. She never signed anything. I asked for her to be added as an authorized signer to my account. BarclayCard sent her a card of her own to use. About XX/XX/XXXX she was finished with her need to use my credit card and I removed her as a user. 

She went to check her credit bureau the other day and found Barclay Card to be reporting MY full balance to her credit report. She called Barclay Card and they said they could not talk with her about it since she is not a signer on the account. I called Barclay Card to have it corrected and they said that I had to submit letter, via regular mail, and all of the supporting documentation to have my daughters credit reporting reversed. 

Their fraudulent mistake is not my problem to fix. Barclay Card acknowledges that they should not be reporting on my daughters credit report. They should not have reported it to her credit bureau while she was using the card and they certainly should not be reporting it now. However, they said they will maintain the fraudulent reporting unless I write them a letter with all the required documentation to have it removed. 

This is the exact kind of bullying behavior a big bank is supposed to have stopped a long time ago. So they have made an error and now it is MY problem to fix it. Unacceptable. And Illegal. 

Barclay Card has my complaint and my daughter 's complaint by phone and now through this correspondence. If they do not correct the erroneous reporting in a reasonable amount of time I will be forced to take more serious actions regarding the fraud they have committed against my daughter. Not to mention the illegal release of information about my account to her ( she should have never known the balance of my card at anytime, ever ). 

In my conversation with two Barclay representatives on the phone this evening both confirmed that the reporting should not have occurred as she was merely an authorized user with no responsibility for the credit and that the only way I can correct a credit reporting error, even if it is completely their fault, is in writing to a mailing address with supporting documentation which includes my daughter sending them, by mail, a full copy of the erroneous credit reporting. That exposes my family to unnecessary risk.

I never agreed to, authorized or had any knowledge of the increased rate until after I had left the property. 

Despite the overwhelming evidence validating this to indeed be a billing error Chase has still taken 10 months and counting to correct it. This violated the Fair Billing Practices Act.",JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,78723,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

I opened an account online on XX/XX/19 and transferred {$50000.00} from my external bank to Capital 1 bank on XX/XX/19. I kept my daily balance above {$50000.00} until XX/XX/19. On XX/XX/19, I transferred some money out. I thought I already passed 90 day requirement. In XX/XX/XXXX., I contacted Capital 1 to check the bonus status. Surprisingly I was told that I was 1 day short of requirement. Based on their explanation, I have to deposit within 10 days of account opening. Then I have to maintain a daily balance of {$50000.00} or more for 90 days following the initial funding period, which is 10 days. So even I have kept my daily balance above {$50000.00} longer than 90 days, I am not qualified for {$500.00} bonus. I went back to read the fine print carefully for this promotion. It states that "" Deposit {$50000.00} or more of new money from an external bank within the first 10 days of account opening. You will earn the {$500.00} bonus once youve maintained a daily balance of {$50000.00} or more for the first 90 days following the Initial Funding Period ''. It did not clearly and specifically pointed out that the initial funding period is TEN days, regardless when you funded account after opening it. I thought funding period referred to the time between opening account and funding account, as long as it is no more than 10 days. If I funded my new account on the 10th day of account opening and kept the daily minimum balance requirement for 90 days, I would have qualified for the bonus. In my case, I funded my new account on the 3rd day of account opening and kept the daily minimum balance requirement for 97 days, I am not qualified for bonus. The fine print words are very ambiguous and confusing. If it made it clear at the first place, I would have kept {$50000.00} for longer time. I hope Capital 1 Bank can reconsider my case and issue the bonus that I deserve. Thank you very much for your help!",CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,WA,980XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"In XX/XX/2018 as I was preparing to sell my house, I was reviewing my payment history on Ditech Financial and noticed that they had made an error in XX/XX/2018 they posted my mortgage payment twice on, and then reversed the duplicated payment that was posted in error on XX/XX/XXXX and then they then reversed the payment a second time on XX/XX/XXXX, when I called to inquire about this the representative first told me they had re-applied the second one on XX/XX/XXXX and he sent me a PDF showing this payment was in fact re-applied, what I found very odd was that the principal balance I could see online and the principal balance of this PDF they sent me was exactly the same. I questioned him on the fact that the math on the PDF that was sent did not add up and that the principal balance was exactly the same as what I see online without the reapplied payment. If in fact they did reapply that payment then there would be a significant difference in the principal balance. I was then told that it was a programming issue and that the computer system shows different information online as to what they have in the system, I informed him that I am a computer engineer and what he is saying sounds very suspicious. I asked to speak with a supervisor who also argued with me about this imaginary reapplied payment. The PDF that was sent to me was only available to view for 45 mins then it was removed from the system. I have since sold my house and probably can't recover the money that they have shorted me, however I am extremely concerned that they are possibly doing the same to other consumers",Ditech Financial LLC,AL,,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

after these experience I learned that Capital One intentionally sent documents that weren't file with court causing me to believe it was too late to do anything for example after getting documents about a judgement, about a deposition, and when I called the court the court refer me to the law office ( left many voice mails without getting a call back } the law office who is listed as representing capitol one would not speak to me to give me information it almost felt like they had no intensions of working with me for example I spent a lot time calling them to make payments arrangements even after the judgment by error I was transfer to the attorney where he was obligated to transfer me to the gentlemen who is handling my case ( when made payments arrangements I was promise in writing about the payments arrangements I have not received anything and again I keep leaving voice mails never gotten a call back ) and by the way I have being making payments on this account, but none of the payments are being reported to credit report.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"In XXXX I had a mortgage with Cardinal Financial Company. My mortgage at this time was escrowed for both taxes and insurance. In XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my existing mortgage through Cardinal Financial Company for a loan that did not have escrow. During my loan process the month prior my payoff was ordered. In that same month my Insurance was due to be disbursed from my escrow account. My Insurance was not paid out as it should have been as the policy renewal date was XX/XX/XXXX. I was not made aware at the time of closing or even prior that my insurance was not paid out of my escrow in XXXX and that my renewal for XX/XX/XXXX needed to be paid by me for the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX policy. This in turn caused by policy to lapse for 12mo causing me to have to purchase a worse case policy ( $ XXXX/Yr ) vs. the premium policy ( $ XXXX/Yr ) that I had. 
I reached out to Cardinal Financial Company in mid-XX/XX/XXXX once I found out my policy cancelled due to non-payment despite my account being escrowed. Initially I was told by the Insurance Department of Cardinal Financial that they did not get an invoice ( my further research found that was false as the insurance premium amount had been updated in their system to show the invoice amount for the renewal policy ). I was told that since I refinanced I should have paid it when my escrow was returned to me ( Issue with this : My insurance was due XX/XX/XXXX and I did not close on my refinance until XX/XX/XXXX - the insurance should have already been disbursed and paid by escrow ) ; I was also told when my payoff was ordered they netted my escrow from the payoff amount so all escrow payouts were froze ( I did not request this ) ; I received a letter in the mail this past week referencing my new loan and was told that their records show my insurance was good through XX/XX/XXXX and I needed to reach out to my new servicer ( False : They admitted in a conversation I had with them that they received a Notice to Cancel the day before I closed on my refinance ( XX/XX/XXXX ) - They still never said anything ) ; The last conversation I had with them they said that once a payoff is ordered they stop all escrow disbursements for 45/days and I was notified of this however could not tell me when or how I was notified ( I reviewed all of my closing docs that I signed and never signed anything about this. The only notice that was provided at close was my settlement statement that indicated I needed to cover my property expense going forward which I was aware of as I no longer escrowed ).",CARDINAL FINANCIAL COMPANY,TN,371XX,Closed with explanation,No,N/A

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"I started a loan with with Ethos Lending ( XXXX XXXX, Ca ) on XX/XX/18 and had given them all of the information they requested and my credit scores were excellent that they used from a credit report done XXXX. Then two days before my signing date on XX/XX/XXXX, ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) they told me I would be charged a 1.099 % fee because my credit scores had dropped ( three credit agencies ) from XXXX to XXXX. I told them it was a mistake and when I called the credit agencies they told me it was because of a XXXX $ XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX bill that was unpaid. So I called XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and found out it was not my primary bill, but a secondary bill from another property and they had sent it to the wrong address, not my current address they send my other bills. XXXX XXXXXXXX sent a letter out ( which they never do ) to all three credit agencies to negate this late report. Within 15 days my credit scores all rose 80 points to back over 740.  Well I signed the paperwork in the mean time and when I went back to Ethos they said they wouldn't rebate me the fees.. 
First I think when they first ran my report to see the excellent scores and approved my loan they shouldn't be able to change that and charge me {$4900.00} two days before I sign the paperwork, just to hit me up with another charge. 
And secondly when I show they the low ratings were wrong ( shown by the letter from XXXX saying to delete this report to all three credit agencies ) and then two weeks later all three scores rose to their normally high scores they should refund me the {$4900.00} charge because the ratings were false reports ... ..

I asked XXXX, could he tell me what late payments did XXXX report to the 3 credit bureaus because my husband had his credit report pulled by the apartment complex and was denied the apartment because of several late payments on his credit report, I explained to him me and my husband are both on the car loan. XXXX stated, I have limited visablity to you car loan account. I said, You are a supervisor and you cant tell me what 30 day late payments XXXX submitted to the credit bureaus. XXXX said, We report differently to the credit bureaus, for instance if it the XXXX and we havent received a payment by then we report you to the credit bureaus. I informed him that was illegal because by law you must be 30 days late on payments before you can submit it to the 3 credit bureaus. XXXX is giving me this illegal information on a recorded XXXX line. He instructed me to send a letter to the XXXX direct dispute department. After he gave me that information, I informed him that I would be submitting a complaint with the CFPB about these late payments and this wasnt the first time that XXXX  sent incorrect info to the credit bureaus on this car loan. 
Please remove inaccurate late payments for these months from the 3 credit bureaus ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Also is there a way from preventing the month of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from being submitted to these three credit bureaus Transuion, XXXX and XXXX. 
Ive attached a copy of screenshot from my car payments when I submitted them when I pay them via online. I dont have the screenshot of XXXX because it was in my old phone and it just blacked out on me and for some reason it wasnt saved in the cloud.","TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,750XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A

Please be advised that this all took place before the XX/XX/XXXX withdrawal was to take place as well as the withdrawal for XX/XX/XXXX which was also removed..

It was supposed to be two watches. I received the package from some random country in the XXXX XXXX. It contained only ONE ( 1 ) watch, which was a poor, cheap, extremley bad XXXX  branded replica watch. In the listing it stated a model for i guess a replica watch, which if you look up the model name "" XXXX XXXX '' you can see it is a very high end, very authentic looking XXXX  branded replica which i did not know til AFTER this whole ordeal. I provided all this proof that i only received one watch, a poor replica, even sent this comparison pictures of the products and discover still went against me. 

ANYONE with two eyes and a brain can see these are NOT the same watches, i was duped, scammed, defrauded, any other word for a scam! These are NOT the same watches, i paid for a XXXX  XXXX, either way i did not knowingly buy a replica watch. I ordered two and received one. 

In the end, i filed a complaint with ebay, they voted in my favor and have the email but they banned me from ebay/paypal and while they told me i was refunded or would be refunded i never was. When i called them they proceeded to tell me they had issue in their system to refund my to my DISCOVER card and they themselves told me to dispute the charge and i would be refunded no problem. 

CLEARLY these is a problem, the seller sent a letter to XXXX saying a "" XXXX  XXXX '' is not a replica XXXX  when a simple XXXX search clearly shows it is, as well as the proof ive provided. 

the seller one sent me ONE ( 1 ) watch when i ordered TWO ( 2 ) watches. So even if Discover were  to want to scam me, i should only be charged 50 % of the total amount. 

DISCOVER has been trying to scam me for months, i have provided undisputable proof of the charge not being valid and that i should be refunded in full. I provided email of ebay awarding my refund to my discover that DISCOVER themselves asked for, now they are ignoring it when for months thats what they requested. Now they are attempting to take money from me over a cheap, counterfeit XXXX. I will forward this complaint to XXXX themselves in hopes they take a stand against Discover since they are allowing customers to get scammed by the worst looking replica XXXX  watch on the market, this is {$5.00} watch in a back alley and not the $ 500+ replica i was told i would even get when i did NOT know i was ordering a XXXX replica.",DISCOVER BANK,MI,480XX,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A
